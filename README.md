## Implementing Features

If you want to implement something new please create a new branch along with the name of the feature you want to implement:
```
$ git branch branch_name
$ git checkout branch_name // Navigates to your newly created branch
```

Once you have implemented whatever it is that needed to be done you can then merge your work into the master branch:
```
$ git checkout master // Navigate back to main branch
$ git merge branch_name // Type in the branch you want to merge with
```
Once you have successfully completed the merge, delete the old branch by:
```
$ git branch -d branch_name
```

## Committing Updates

First check if your branch is up to date by typing:
```
$ git fetch --dry-run // Show what would be done, without making any changes.
```

If there is no response, that means that you are up to date with main repository so you can just push your changes using:
```
$ git push
```

If there is a response, that means that someone has updated the main repository since your last pull/fetch. You will have
to run some extra commands listed below:

```
$ git stash // Stash your local changes
$ git pull // Update your branch to the latest code
$ git stash apply // Merge your local changes into the latest code
```

Then simply `add` `commit` and `push` your desired changes.

*Note: You could also simply just run `git pull` however it is easier using this method.* 

## Reset your local directory
Sometimes you will want to scrap some of the work you done or you just want to reset your workspace. You can do so by:
```
$ git fetch origin // Update your local repository. Note: this does not update your local directory
$ git reset --hard origin/master // This will delete any local commits you have made that have not already been pushed
$ git clean -f // Which will remove any local files you may have added
```
